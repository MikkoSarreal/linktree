# Linktree Frontend Assesment

## Requirements

* Node 14 or later

## Installation
1. Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed and up to date
2. Clone this repo
3. `cd linktree`
4. `npm install`

## Running localhost

1. Start the app by opening a new terminal in the same folder and run `npm start`.  When it's ready the app should start in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## Testing

Unit testing can be started by running `npm test` in the app root folder.

## Future Improvements
* Improve accessbility
* Improve responsiveness

## Decisions
* Utilized css variables instead of library/framework-specific code (styled-components, jss) to apply global styles. This is to make any transistion to different code easier if we do decide in the future.
